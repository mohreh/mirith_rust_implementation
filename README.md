# MiRitH (MinRank-in-the-Head) in Rust

MiRitH (MinRank-in-the-Head) is a digital signature scheme based on the hardness of the MinRank problem. This document focuses on the implementation of MiRitH in the Rust programming language and the potential benefits and improvements that can be achieved by using Rust.

## Scientific Background

Informally, the MinRank problem asks to find a non-trivial low-rank linear combination of some given matrices over a finite field. The construction of MiRitH starts from an MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK) of a solution to the MinRank problem, which is then used to construct a 5-pass identification scheme. This identification protocol is converted into a non-interactive signature scheme via the Fiatâ€“Shamir transform.

MiRitH is built on top of the MinRank-based signature scheme proposed by Adj, Rivera-Zamarripa, and Verbel [ARZV], which introduced a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol to verify solutions to the MinRank problem using the Kipnis--Shamir modeling.

MiRitH introduces two optimizations over [ARZV]:

1. It improves the MPC protocol by employing an optimization analogous to the one introduced by Kales and Zarevucha [KZ22, Section 2.5]. This optimization is also used in [Fen22].
2. It improves the MPC protocol by reducing the size of a random matrix used in the protocol, leveraging an optimization introduced by Feneuil [Fen22].

## Potential Improvements

By implementing MiRitH in Rust, several improvements can be explored:

1. **Performance Optimizations**:

- Leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions and avoid unnecessary copying or allocations.
- Explore parallelization opportunities using Rust's concurrency features.
- Optimize critical algorithms and operations for better performance.

2. **Security Enhancements**:

- Utilize Rust's memory safety guarantees and type system to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Implement constant-time operations to mitigate timing attacks.
- Integrate with existing cryptographic libraries like RustCrypto or ring for battle-tested implementations.

3. **Extensibility and Modularity**:

- Design the Rust implementation with a modular and extensible architecture.
- Separate concerns and responsibilities into distinct modules, libraries or crates.
- Explore the possibility of implementing additional signature schemes or advanced features like ring signatures.

4. **Portability and Distribution**:

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility and provide pre-built binaries or packages for popular platforms.

By embracing Rust's features and ecosystem, the MiRitH implementation can benefit from improved performance, enhanced security, better usability, and increased maintainability and extensibility.
